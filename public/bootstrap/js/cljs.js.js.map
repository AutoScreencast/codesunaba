The second argument is a callback of\n                        one argument. If an error occurs an :error key should be\n                        supplied.\n    :def-emits-var    - sets whether def (and derived) forms return either a Var\n                        (if set to true) or the def init value (if false). Default\n                        is false.\n    :checked-arrays   - if :warn or :error, checks inferred types and values passed\n                        to aget/aset. Logs for incorrect values if :warn, throws if\n                        :error. Defaults to false.\n    :static-fns       - employ static dispatch to specific function arities in\n                        emitted JavaScript, as opposed to making use of the\n                        `call` construct. Defaults to false.\n    :fn-invoke-direct - if `true`, does not generate `.call(null...)` calls for\n                        unknown functions, but instead direct invokes via\n                        `f(a0,a1...)`. Defaults to `false`.\n    :target           - use `:nodejs` if targeting Node.js. Takes no other options\n                        at the moment.\n    :ns               - optional, the namespace in which to evaluate the source.\n    :verbose          - optional, emit details from compiler activity. Defaults to\n                        false.\n    :context          - optional, sets the context for the source. Possible values\n                     are `:expr`, `:statement` and `:return`. Defaults to\n                      `:expr`.\n\n  cb (function)\n    callback, will be invoked with a map. If succesful the map will contain\n    a :value key with the result of evaluation and :ns the current namespace.\n    If unsuccessful will contain a :error key with an ex-info instance describing\n    the cause of failure.\"\n  ([state source cb]\n   (eval-str state source nil cb))\n  ([state source name cb]\n   (eval-str state source name nil cb))\n  ([state source name opts cb]\n   {:pre [(atom? state) (string? source)\n          (valid-name? name) (valid-opts? opts) (fn? cb)]}\n   (eval-str*\n     {:*compiler*     state\n      :*data-readers* tags/*cljs-data-readers*\n      :*analyze-deps* (:analyze-deps opts true)\n      :*cljs-dep-set* ana/*cljs-dep-set*\n      :*load-macros*  (:load-macros opts true)\n      :*load-fn*      (or (:load opts) *load-fn*)\n      :*eval-fn*      (or (:eval opts) *eval-fn*)}\n     source name opts cb)))\n\n;;; Support for cljs.core/eval\n\n;; The following volatiles and fns set up a scheme to\n;; emit function values into JavaScript as numeric\n;; references that are looked up.

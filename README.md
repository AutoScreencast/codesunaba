# Code Sunaba

A simple ClojureScript sandbox (“sunaba” means “sandbox” in Japanese).

This app was scaffolded using [create-reagent-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-reagent-app), which is powered by [Shadow-CLJS](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs).

See a [live demo](https://codesunaba.netlify.app/) of the app.
